# IoT Garden Management System


## Description

The IoT Garden Management System is a sophisticated and efficient solution that enables users to monitor and control their garden's soil moisture levels, automate watering, and manage garden lights and decorations. This system is built using the NodeMcu board as the main controller, making it an excellent choice for IoT applications.

### Key Features:

1. **Soil Moisture Monitoring:**
   The system employs soil moisture sensors to continuously monitor the moisture levels in the garden. This real-time data is transmitted to a web application for easy monitoring and analysis.

2. **Automated Watering System:**
   Using the web application, users can define their desired soil moisture range. When the soil moisture falls below the specified threshold, the system automatically activates the water motor, providing the necessary water to the plants.

3. **User-Friendly Web Application:**
   The web application provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface, allowing users to access real-time data on soil moisture levels, garden light status, and decorations. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and data updates are handled using AJAX and jQuery.

4. **Firebase Integration:**
   The microcontroller communicates with the web application via Firebase, a real-time database service. This integration ensures seamless and instantaneous data synchronization between the NodeMcu board and the web application.

5. **Garden Light and Decoration Control:**
   In addition to managing soil moisture and watering, the web application allows users to control the garden light system and decorations. This feature enhances the garden's ambiance and provides users with full control over the garden's aesthetics.

### Benefits:

- **Efficient Water Management:**
  By automating the watering process based on user-defined soil moisture ranges, water usage is optimized, leading to water conservation and healthier plants.

- **Remote Access and Monitoring:**
  Users can access the web application from any device with an internet connection, enabling remote monitoring and control of the garden's conditions.

- **Real-Time Data:**
  The use of Firebase ensures real-time updates, enabling users to make timely decisions and respond to changes in soil moisture levels or garden lighting.

- **Customizable Garden Control:**
  Users have the flexibility to set their preferred soil moisture ranges and customize the garden lighting and decorations, tailoring the system to their preferences.
